## Deep-Neural-Networks-Architectures-For-Computer-Vision-Tasks

This repository bundles the implementation of some well-known Deep Neural Networks Architectures intended for Computer Vision Task using Pytorch (why pytorch ? cuz Tensorflow is for boomers ! duh...).

In each folder, you will find the implmentation of the corresponding architecture. If you want to understand the general folder structure, then head to ``/Deep Neural Networks``, where you will find a generic DNN implementation along with descriptions for each folder and file.

I'll be working more on this repository in the upcoming days, as I have some architectures (and improvements) in mind to do. I'll try to summarize them here:
