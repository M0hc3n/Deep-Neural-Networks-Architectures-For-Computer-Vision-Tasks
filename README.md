## Deep-Neural-Networks-Architectures-For-Computer-Vision-Tasks

This repository bundles the implementation of some well-known Deep Neural Networks Architectures made for Computer Vision Task using Pytorch (why pytorch ? cuz Tensorflow is for boomers ! duh...).

In each folder, you will find the implmentation of the corresponding architecture, and a set of resources (articles, papers, videos...) that helped to understand the discussed architecture. If you want to understand the general folder structure, then head to ``/Deep Neural Networks``, where you will find a generic DNN implementation along with descriptions for each folder and file.

I'll be working more on this repository in the upcoming time, as I have some architectures (and improvements) in mind to do. I'll try to summarize them here:

- [x] Deep Neural Network
- [ ] Genrative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - [x] Deep Convolutional Genrative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)
  - [x] Conditional Genrative Adversarial Networks (cGAN)
  - [ ] Cycle Genrative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN)
  - [ ] Bicycle Genrative Adversarial Networks (BicycleGAN)
- [x] Residual Networks
- [ ] GoogleLeNet (Inception)
  - [x] Inception v1
  - [ ] Inception v2
  - [ ] Inception v3
  - [ ] Inception v4
  - [ ] Inception-ReNet
  
A huge thanks for Rohan Paul, and his Youtube series (which you find its code base [here](https://github.com/rohan-paul/MachineLearning-DeepLearning-Code-for-my-YouTube-Channel/tree/master)) for being a motivator of this repository. He had also helped a lot with understanding the original research papers and implementing those architectures.
