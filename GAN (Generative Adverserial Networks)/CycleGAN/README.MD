## Cycle GAN:

Cycle GAN is an architecture used in Image Translation to map a given image from a domain (Summer Images for e.g) to another domain (Winter Images). See the results below (30 epochs):

The following, is an implementation of the latter architecture. I am also attaching a set of usefull links:
